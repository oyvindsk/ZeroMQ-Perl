*** WARNING ***

You're using libzmq '%s'!

It is known that when used with libzmq < 2.1, some calls to 
    \$socket->recv()
does not terminate even when a signal is sent (in such cases you
need to resort to using SIGKILL). 

You should really be thinking about upgrading your libzmq to 2.1 or
higher, and recompile ZMQ.pm against the new library.
